Clone this repository.

Run `npm run dev` to build the site. (In VSC, open a new terminal window - change it to a bash window for the run command to work)

After the command completes, the site will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000/` in your browser.

```console
  npm run build
  npm run serve
```

## Deployment

The content is automatically managed and deployed on the `gh-pages` branch by the deploy GitHub Actions *Deploy* workflow.
