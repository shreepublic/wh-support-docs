2082156,DT036276,Batch launcher error when DB-to-JMS is enabled with WebSphere Liberty server,CEF,Application Development Environment,Server Development Environment,,"**Issue Description:**\nThe batch launcher fails when DB-to-JMS is enabled in conjunction with WebSphere Liberty server.\n\nIn addition, the server logs will include one or both of the following messages:\n * User ?UNAUTHENTICATED? does not have a role on CuramServer'\n * java.lang.ClassCastException: curam.util.invoke.EJSLocal0SLEJBMethod_2b4572e3 incompatible with 'curam.util.invoke.Method'\n\n**User Interface Impact:** No\n\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\n # Set application property 'Database-to-jms - enable flag' to 'True'.\n # Set application property 'Database-to-jms - Notification batch launcher mode' to '1'.\n # Set application property 'Database-to-jms - Notification host name' and 'Database-to-jms - Notification port number' to reference an SPM application on WebSphere Liberty.\n # Run the batch launcher.\n # Issue: [batchlauncher] A runtime exception occurred: An error occurred triggering the database-to-JMS server at '<host name>':'<port number>' (SSL mode: false). Note that properties 'curam.batchlauncher.dbtojms.notification.host' and 'curam.batchlauncher.dbtojms.notification.port' respectively must be set to the host and port number on which the Curam client application is deployed because the database to JMS server is part of the Curam client application.\n\n**Resolution:**\nWhen DB-to-JMS is enabled, the batch launcher can authenticate with the server to obtain an LTPA token required by WebSphere Liberty to trigger a database-to-JMS transfer.\n\nLTPA token usage is enabled by setting the application property 'Database-to-jms - Enable LTPA token usage for DB-to-JMS triggering'\n(Technical ID: curam.batchlauncher.dbtojms.notification.ltpa) to 'True'.\n\nTo help with troubleshooting another property 'Database-to-jms - Enable tracing for DB-to-JMS triggering'\n(Technical ID: curam.batchlauncher.dbtojms.notification.trace) is now available. Setting this property to 'True' enables diagnostic logging for DB-to-JMS operations. Previously it was necessary to set the application-wide property 'Tracing level' (Technical ID: curam.trace) to 'trace_verbose' to activate this logging, which was less convenient.\n"

2079335,,Optimize method for preventing the creation of unnecessary notifications for provider management cases used for financials processing,ENT,Provider Management,,,"**Issue Description:**\nIn a prior release, a mechanism was introduced to prevent the generation of unnecessary notifications for provider management case types that should not generate notifications because they are intended only for use in generating financials. This mechanism for excluding certain case types from generating notifications worked by checking the case type in identified workflows. The previous approach included case types that did not generate any notifications, which could cause a performance overhead.\n\n** User Interface Impact:** No\n\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\nThis issue is dependent on user data so it is not directly reproducible.\n\n**Resolution:**\nThis issue has been resolved now and the mechanism for excluding provider management case types that should not generate a notification has been updated, to only generate notifications for the following case types:\n* CASEREASSESSMENTNOTIFICATION\n* DEFAULTCASENOTIFICATION \n\nFor more information, see {{https://www.ibm.com/docs/spm/8.0.2?topic=sets-products}}. \n\n\n"

Saving can be done either by closing the Word Editing session and confirming in a pop-up modal that is displayed or by selecting the commit changes button on the File Edit Control Panel. When users select to save changes by closing the Word editing session, if they wait more than 5 seconds before confirming in the pop-up dialog that appears in the browser (asking if they want to save their edits to the Cúram server), the edits are not saved.\n\n**User Interface Impact:** No\n\n**Prerequisite(s):**\n# Install Microsoft Word.\n# Install a supported (supported for Social Program Management Word Integration) Java Runtime Environment.\n# Install Google Chrome.\n# Install and enable the Cúram File Edit Native Messaging Bridge Extension for Google Chrome.

When the Word Integration Assistant is used through a Google Chrome browser and a user chooses to save changes by closing the Word Editing session, if an error is encountered the File Control Panel closes.

Therefore, a message is sent in error by the browser to the Word Integration Assistant instructing it to close Word and then itself. The Word Integration Assistant now ignores these events from other Chrome browser windows. Changes were also made to bring the actual behavior in line with the preferred behavior described here [[https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spm/8.0.2?topic=reference-file-edit-widget]].
