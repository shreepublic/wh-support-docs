SPM-132034,DT036275,DBtoJMS LTPA mode does not handle mixed case header names correctly,CEF,Application Development Environment,Infrastructure,Batch Processing,"*Issue Description:*
The Batch Launcher uses HTTPS to make a DBtoJMS transfer request to the application server. This involves transferring cookies and other HTTPS headers including 'Transfer-Encoding', 'Content-Length', 'Set-Cookie'. If the casing header names used by the application server did not exactly match the above names, the DBtoJMS request would fail.

*User Interface Impact:* No

*Prerequisites:*
Customise the application server to change HTTP header name 'Set-Cookie' to 'set-cookie', that is, make it lowercase.

*Steps to Reproduce:*

# Set application property 'Database-to-jms - enable flag' to 'True'.
# Set application property 'Database-to-jms - Enable LTPA token usage for DB-to-JMS triggering' to 'True'.
# Set properties 'Database-to-jms - Notification hostname' and 'Database-to-jms - Notification port number' to reference the appropriate application server.
# Run the Batch Launcher.
# Issue: The Batch Launcher will fail with an error:  infrastructure:RUN&#95;ID&#95;DBTOJMS&#95;ERROR&#95;NOTIFYING&#95;SERVER: An error occurred triggering the database-to-JMS server.

SPM-131992,,"When configuring localizable text for the names of WorkQueue, Organisation Structure, Job, Location and Slot, duplicate name text can be used for multiple records in the same language",CEF,Administration Suite,,,"*Issue Description:*
Due to the addition of multi-locale support for the ?name? fields on WorkQueue, Organisation Structure, Job, Location and Slot, it is now possible to bypass some validations. Specifically, those duplicate validations that enforce uniqueness on these name fields. The ?Add Translation? link provides two avenues for bypassing these validations: adding a translation and editing a translation.

*User Interface Impact:* No

*Steps to Reproduce:*

# Log in as an administrator.
# Navigate to the Work Queues page under Workflow in the shortcuts panel. 
# Select the ?Add Name Text Translation? icon beside one of the work queue names.
# The View Localizable Text modal is displayed.
# Click Edit on one of the translations and copy this text.
# Select the ?Add Name Text Translation? beside a different work queue in the list.
# Click Edit on a translation with the same locale as the copied one and paste the text into the field and hit save.
# Issue: No validation is thrown to prevent the same text from being used for another work queue with the same locale.

*Resolution:*
Adding a new translation or making an edit to an existing translation via the ?Add Name Text Translation? link will now validate the uniqueness of the translation within the locale for the field in question. 

"
SPM-131968,,"Search results for Work Queue, Organization Unit and Position are incorrectly being filtered by the user?s locale when a user performs a search",CEF,,,,"*Issue Description:*
When a search is performed for business objects such as Work Queue, Organization Unit and Position using a search criterion of Name that is now translatable and the user?s locale is set to include a language and locale, for example, en&#95;US, the search will only return results where translations have been configured for the business object in the user?s locale. It will not return results that match the base language of the user?s locale, for example, en.

*User Interface Impact: No*

*Prerequisites:*

# Log in as a system administrator.
# Navigate to Property Administration under Application Data in the shortcuts panel.
# Search for the property ?curam.environment.app.menu.locale.toggle.enabled?.

SPM-131616,DT036847,Incorrect validation error is being thrown preventing adding delivery pattern on a product delivery case,ENT,Financial Management,Financials,,"*Issue Description:*
When modifying a delivery pattern on a product delivery, which has an underlying rule set with no daily tags, a validation is thrown preventing the update. The validation states that the date chosen is not a valid reoccurrence date even though it is.

*User Interface Impact:* No

*Prerequisites:*

# To reproduce the issue, the product should have the following two delivery patterns associated with it:
## Every Two Months By Check In Advance On Day 1

SPM-130711,DT036819,Allow customization of the KeyServer used to generate the IEG scriptexecutionID,CEF,Intelligent Evidence Gathering,,,"*Issue Description:*
Previously, the ID generation strategy for IEG was not customizable because it was hardwired to use the ?DEFAULT' KeyServer. That meant that the ID generation strategy, for example, human-readable vs non-human readable, could not be customized without impacting other ID generation processes that also depended on the ?DEFAULT? KeyServer.

*User Interface Impact:* No

*Steps to Reproduce:*

# Check the value of the ?DEFAULT' KeyServer in your environment. By default, it should be set to non-human readable. If not, set it to non-human readable.
# Using the Citizen Engagement portal, run an IEG script in the browser and observe the URL as you progress through the script. It will contain a parameter that represents the executionID, for example, ?/apply/8536080512471531520?.
# Change the value of the ?DEFAULT? KeyServer to human-readable.
# Repeat step 2. This time observe that the generated ID is a human-readable value, such as 10234. 
# Issue: The IEG ID generation process is dependent on the ?DEFAULT? KeyServer. The ID generation process cannot be customized without impacting other business functions that rely on the ?DEFAULT? KeyServer.

*Resolution:*
IEG can now be configured to use a custom KeyServer to allow more control over the key generation strategy. The custom KeyServer can be introduced by creating a new system property with the property ID ?curam.ieg.script.executionid.keyset? and the value set to the ?KeySetCode? of the custom KeyServer.

When resilience is turned on for intake applications and evidence is configured for pre-authorization sharing on an application case, if the evidence is added as part of the intake process, the evidence is not brokered to the target case when the application case is created.

*User Interface Impact:* No

*Prerequisites:*

# Log in as a system administrator.
# Navigate to Property Administration under the Application Data section in the shortcuts panel.
# Search for the property ?curam.application.preauthorization.sharing.enabled? and update its value to ?true?.

# Issue: As soon as the application case is created, the evidence configured for pre-authorization sharing should be brokered to the person since we have pre-authorization sharing enabled for that evidence. However, the evidence is not being shared.

*Resolution:*
During the intake process with resilience on, evidence sharing does not occur on application cases until authorization is enacted. This was due to the delivery plan logic inside the evidence broker not being pre-authorization aware. This logic has been updated to examine each piece of evidence and its underlying configuration and share the evidence before authorization if the evidence is configured for pre-authorization sharing.

This meant that a navigator user could no longer resume an IEG script on behalf of a citizen, and vice versa.  Now, the motivation flow has been updated to apply the correct authorization checks allowing navigator users to resume applications that a citizen started.

SPM-128298,,Update the Evidence Broker to support the sharing of evidence to Holding Cases,ENT,Evidence Broker,,,"*Issue Description:*
The Evidence Broker now supports sharing evidence to a Holding Case. It previously only supported sharing evidence from a Holding Case. This meant that the round-tripping of evidence was not possible.

*User Interface Impact:* No

*Prerequisites:*

# Create an XSL transformation to transform the attributes associated with a particular evidence type, Vehicle, for example, into XML that can be stored on the Holding Evidence entity.
# Ensure the Vehicle evidence is activated automatically once captured.
# Ensure evidence-sharing configurations have been set up to support round-tripping. For example, this could be the sharing of Holding Evidence on a Holding Case to Vehicle evidence on another case type, and vice-versa. Set Trusted Source to ?Yes' for the configurations.

*Steps to Reproduce:*

# Log in to the Citizen Portal.
# Launch an Advanced Life Event script to capture Vehicle evidence.
# Populate all the necessary attributes before clicking Save.
# The Vehicle evidence is stored on the Holding Evidence entity on the Holding Case and is shared to the target case type, integrated case, for example.
## Ensure the Vehicle evidence is active on the target case type.
# Now modify the Vehicle evidence on the integrated case and activate the changes.
# Issue: The Vehicle evidence is not shared back to the Holding Evidence on the Holding Case.

SPM-128297,DT036713,Dynamic evidence initialization - ThreadLocal issue causes error for dynamic evidence pages,CEF,Technical Services,Client Development Environment,Infrastructure,"*Issue Description:*
In certain initialization instances, the dynamic evidence cache can become out of sync and result in a dynamic evidence error on the screen. The asynchronous nature of this problem means that it will only occur intermittently and cannot be reproduced on demand.

*User Interface Impact:* No

*Steps to Reproduce:*

This was reproduced on a single-pod development environment:

# Start up a new pod on Websphere Liberty Profile (Only).
# Open a person home page.
# Navigate to the Evidence tab.
# Issue: Expand one of the dynamic evidence line items (Addresses, Bank Account, Contact Preferences, Gender Details, etc). If the newly started pod serves this request and uses the same thread which was used to start the applicationController, the error will occur:
## The dynamic evidence page will fail to open and display the usual 'This page could not be displayed...' message.
## The server log will contain this message followed by several stack traces: curam.util.common.domain.DomainException: ERROR: Domain definition initialization failed before loading 'DynEvdDomains.xml'. (-121726)_._
## The server log will also contain 404 messages related to each dynamic evidence page it attempts to display. For example: Caused by: java.io.FileNotFoundException: JSPG0036E: Failed to find resource /jsps/dyne/DynEvd_create_PDC0000256_19000103_false_Evidenc0.jspx.



The affected pod does not recover from this initialization problem and will not be able to serve any dynamic pages thereafter. The affected pod must be restarted to clear the problem.

*Resolution:*
Error has been resolved by addressing initialization steps to expedite the initialization of dynamic evidence.

At server startup when two different evidences are accessed at the same time a conflict can occur leading to a SAX parse error.

*User Interface Impact:* No

*Steps to Reproduce:*

The asynchronous nature of this problem means that it will only occur intermittently and cannot reliably be reproduced on demand.

# Start up a server.
# Open two browsers and navigate to the server just started.
# In each browser search for a person and open their page.
# In each browser navigate to their Evidence tab.
# In one browser expand the 'Addresses' evidence - do not wait for it to open, proceed to the following step as quickly as possible.
# In the other browser expand the 'Birth and Death Details'.
# Issue: If the thread race error occurred, one of the evidence screens will fail to display and instead 'The page you have requested is not available.' will be displayed. Workaround: The affected JVM must be restarted to clear the issue.

*Resolution:*
Multiple threads now initialize different evidence pages in an orderly way ensuring that the different evidence pages get added to the cache correctly.
