<h4>Look and Feel</h4>
<p style="font-weight: bold;color: rgb(0,128,128);"><a name="SPM-125678"></a>PO09810, WorkItem:SPM-125678 - Passive modal dialogs can display buttons when opened from a modal dialog<br/><p><b>Issue Description:</b><br/>If a passive modal dialog (a modal dialog with no action controls), is opened from another modal dialog in the application, it incorrectly shows buttons from the previous modal dialog. Users can get confused and think that the buttons can be used in the new context.<br/><br/><b>User Interface Impact:</b> No<br/><br/><b>Steps to Reproduce:</b> N/A<br/><br/><b>Resolution:</b><br/>The buttons are now hidden as expected in passive modal dialogs that open from a modal dialog in the application.<br/><br/></p></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;color: rgb(0,128,128);"><a name="SPM-125680"></a>PO09812, WorkItem:SPM-125680 - Date picker content is partially hidden making it difficult to select a date value<br/><p><b>Issue Description:</b><br/>When you open a date picker positioned at the end of a modal window, the calendar expands, but the dates are not displayed. Scrolling is required to select the hidden dates, but the calendar in the date picker closes when you click the scrollbar. To select a date, you must scroll down using the trackpad or the wheel on the mouse or tab into the widget and use the arrow keys. <br/><br/><b>User Interface Impact:</b> No<br/><br/><b>Steps to Reproduce (Generic):</b><br/> <ol><li>Log in as a caseworker. <li>Register a Person. <li>Create an integrated case. <li>Navigate to the Evidence tab and add new Dividends evidence. <li>Select the date widget on the New Dividends evidence modal. <li>Issue: The date picker expands, but its content is only partially visible. Scrolling is required to select some dates, but the date picker closes when the user clicks on the scrollbar.</ol><b>Resolution:</b><br/>When the date picker calendar opens, all the days from that month are visible and available to be selected without the need to scroll.<br/><br/></p></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;color: rgb(0,128,128);"><a name="SPM-125683"></a>PO09779, WorkItem:SPM-125683 - Form control labels are not displayed when a nested LABEL child element is used<br/><p><b>Issue Description:</b><br/>A form control's label is not displayed on a page or modal if the associated FIELD element in UIM has a nested LABEL child element.<br/><br/>For example, the 'Show Nicknames' label is not displayed for a checkbox form control on the Person Search page if the label is nested.<br/><br/><b>User Interface Impact:</b> No<br/><br/><b>Prerequisite(s):</b><br/> <ul><li>Install Social Program Management from a development installer. <li>Locate the file: ../webclient/components/core/Person/Search/Person_searchCriteriaView.vim. <li>Find the Nickname field:</ul>&lt;FIELD LABEL="Field.Label.Nickname"> &lt;CONNECT> &lt;SOURCE NAME="DISPLAY" PROPERTY="result$dtls$searchWithNicknamesInd" /> &lt;/CONNECT> &lt;CONNECT> &lt;TARGET NAME="ACTION" PROPERTY="personSearchKey$nicknameInd" /> &lt;/CONNECT> &lt;/FIELD><br/><br/> <ul><li>Modify the field so that the LABEL is a child element instead of a FIELD attribute:</ul>&lt;FIELD> &lt;LABEL> &lt;CONNECT> &lt;SOURCE NAME="TEXT" PROPERTY="Field.Label.Nickname" /> &lt;/CONNECT> &lt;/LABEL> &lt;CONNECT> &lt;SOURCE NAME="DISPLAY" PROPERTY="result$dtls$searchWithNicknamesInd" /> &lt;/CONNECT> &lt;CONNECT> &lt;TARGET NAME="ACTION" PROPERTY="personSearchKey$nicknameInd" /> &lt;/CONNECT> &lt;/FIELD><br/><br/><br/> <ul><li>Run the client build (build clean client).</ul><b>Steps to Reproduce:</b><br/> <ol><li>Log in as a caseworker. <li>Navigate to Cases and Outcomes, expand the shortcuts panel, and select Searches. <li>Click Person to open the Person Search. <li>Issue: The Show Nicknames label for the checkbox on the Person Search page is not displayed.</ol><b>Resolution:</b><br/>The JSP generator has been updated so that a label that is associated with a form control on an application page or modal is correctly displayed when a FIELD element has a nested LABEL element in UIM.<br/><br/></p></p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;color: rgb(0,128,128);"><a name="SPM-125192"></a>DT036279, WorkItem:SPM-125192 - Date picker converts input to incorrect dates<br/><p><b>Issue Description:</b><br/>If a caseworker enters a date in an incorrect format, the date gets automatically converted to a date in the correct format. Invalid dates may be input as a result.<br/><br/><b>User Interface Impact:</b> No<br/><br/><b>Steps to Reproduce:</b><br/> <ol><li>Log in as a caseworker. <li>Open the Register Person modal. <li>Enter an incorrect date, for example, 1.2, in the date picker of the Date Of Birth field. <li>Issue: The input gets converted to 01.02.2022, and there is no format validation.</ol><b>Resolution:</b><br/>A validation message is displayed when a caseworker provides a date in the wrong format.<br/><br/></p></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;color: rgb(0,128,128);"><a name="SPM-125644"></a>PO09678, WorkItem:SPM-125644 - Modal windows do not launch after a JavaScript error occurs in the console<br/><p><b>Issue Description:</b><br/>Sometimes a JavaScript error occurs in the console, which results in modal windows not opening. This error is a result of user actions, including deleting existing evidence. After this error occurs, the user must perform the extra step of refreshing the browser to open modal windows.<br/><br/><b>User Interface Impact:</b> No<br/><br/><b>Steps to Reproduce:</b><br/><br/><b>Scenario 1 (Generic):</b><br/><ol><li>Log in as a caseworker and register a new person.<li>Create a new integrated case on the Care & Protection tab and then close the tab.<li>Delete the address evidence on the person page and select the No option.<li>Attempt to add new evidence by selecting the New page action.<li>Issue: The New evidence modal does not open. </ol><b>Scenario 2:</b><br/><ol><li>Log in as an Insurance Affordability caseworker. <li>Register a new person. <li>Select New Application from the tab action menu on the person home page.<li>Enter only the mandatory information.<li>For Household income, choose Yes and enter Income of 5000 yearly for Wages and Salaries.<li>Submit the application.<li>Open the application and authorize it from the action menu.<li>Return to the person tab and refresh.<li>Open the Insurance Affordability integrated case.<li>Click the Evidence tab and then select Verifications.<li>Add proof for the Income Type.<li>Open the All tab under Verifications and the verified income records are displayed.<li>Close all other tabs except the integrated case that is open.<li>Click the person's name in the context panel under their image.<li>Close the person tab that just opened.<li>Now back on the Verifications (All) tab, expand the Income Type record that was verified.<li>Scroll down and under Verification Items Received, select the action menu and select Yes.<li>Close the modal.<li>Click the action menu and select Apply Changes on the In Edit Evidence page.<li>Issue: The window does not open.</ol><b>Resolution:</b><br/>The JavaScript focus error that was causing the problem has been fixed. The modal window now opens when the user creates new evidence and applies changes without having to refresh the browser. <br/><br/></p></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;color: rgb(0,128,128);"><a name="SPM-125645"></a>PO09459, WorkItem:SPM-125645 - Evidence broker incorrectly shares evidence to cases when a case member is end-dated<br/><p><b>Issue Description:</b><br/>The evidence broker incorrectly shares evidence to cases when a case member is end-dated but also has another active case participant role on the case such as Verification Provider.<br/><br/><b>User Interface Impact:</b> No<br/><br/><b>Prerequisite(s):</b><br/><ol><li>Configure evidence sharing from an integrated case to the same integrated case.<li>Select an evidence type that has verifications configured for that type.<li>For the evidence select Share Verifications = Never, Trusted Source = No. <li>Also configure another evidence type as listed in step 3. This evidence does not need to have verifications configured. </ol><b>Steps to Reproduce (Generic):</b><br/><ol><li>Log in as a caseworker.<li>Register Person One and Person Two.<li>Using the integrated case type configured in Prerequisite(s), create a new integrated case for Person One who should be added as a case participant. Add Person Two to the integrated case so that Person Two is also a case participant. <li>On the integrated case, navigate to the Evidence tab and create new evidence for the first evidence configured in the Prerequisite(s) (the evidence has verifications configured). The evidence can be added for either person. <li>Verify the evidence by selecting the second person as the case participant who is verifying the evidence. <li>Based on the appropriate evidence for your integrated case type, end date Person Two so that they are no longer active on the case.<li>Apply evidence changes. <li>Create a new integrated case of the same type for Person Two. <li>Navigate to the Evidence tab and create new evidence based on the second evidence configured in Prerequisite(s) (evidence with no verifications configured for it). <li>Apply evidence changes. <li>Navigate back to the first integrated case. Navigate to the Evidence tab then to Incoming Evidence.<li>Issue: Observe that incoming evidence is shared from the second case to the first case. The second participant is no longer a member of the first case so there should not be incoming evidence.</ol><b>Resolution:</b><br/>Evidence is no longer shared to a case participant on a case if the case participant is not an active case member of the case. The issue was resolved by updating the code to check whether the case participant has an active and un-end-dated case participant role of either the Primary Client or Case Member on the target case when brokering evidence.<br/><br/></p></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;color: rgb(0,128,128);"><a name="SPM-125682"></a>PO09703, WorkItem:SPM-125682 - Third-party address lookup services cannot access information from drop-downs in address fields<br/><p><b>Issue Description:</b><br/>Incorrect address evidence can be created where custom screens that use a third-party address lookup service cannot access data from drop-downs in address fields.<br/><br/><b>User Interface Impact:</b> No<br/><br/><b>Prerequisite(s):</b><br/> <ol><li>A third-party address lookup service and a Social Program Management custom person registration screen that calls the lookup service and populates the results.</ol><b>Steps to Reproduce:</b><br/> <ol><li>Log in as a caseworker. <li>Navigate to Cases and Outcomes, expand the shortcuts panel and select Registration. <li>Click Person to open the Register Person modal. <li>Use the address lookup service to collect the address to be populated. <li>Issue: The address fields are not populated on the person registration screen when the address is selected.</ol><b>Resolution:</b><br/>Two functions are now available in the '<i>curam.util.Dropdown</i>' JavaScript module to support an update to the selected value of an address drop-down by a third-party address lookup service.<br/><br/></p></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;color: rgb(0,128,128);"><a name="SPM-125800"></a>WorkItem:SPM-125800 - Hook point to support draggable modals<br/><p><b>Issue Description:</b><br/>Currently, in IBM Social Program Management Version 8, the Carbon Design System does not allow the modal windows to be moveable.<br/><br/><b>User Interface Impact:</b> No<br/><br/><b>Steps to Reproduce</b>: N/A<br/><br/><b>Resolution:</b><br/>A new JavaScript file that is called <i>webclient/components/core/WebContent/CDEJ/jscript/curam/application/modal/ModalHooks.js</i> is available to allow the implementation of custom functionality to make modal windows moveable.  The function <i>enableDraggableModals(modalRoot)</i> can be implemented in a custom component copy of this file. The modalRoot node of the modal is available within this function and can be updated to implement the required behavior. One of the most common ways to implement this behavior is to use event listeners that listen for users dragging the modals and update the position of the node by using the style attribute. <br/><br/></p></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;color: rgb(0,128,128);"><a name="SPM-125845"></a>PO09820, WorkItem:SPM-125845 - An error is displayed when saving updates to user preferences<br/><p><b>Issue Description:</b><br/>The user preferences modal that is available in the web client allows each user of the application to update certain user settings, such as their time zone. When a user tries to make any changes to the User Preferences, an 'Error 500 - internal server error' message is displayed.<br/><br/><b>User Interface Impact:</b> No<br/><br/><b>Steps to Reproduce:</b><br/><ol><li>Log in as an administrator.<li>Open the Application menu and select the Preferences option.<li>Modify a setting on the Preferences modal. For example, set Enhanced mode to Yes, and click Save.<li>Issue: An 'Error 500 - internal server error' message is displayed. </ol><b>Resolution:</b><br/>Users can now save updates to their user preferences without any errors being displayed. <br/><br/></p></p>

<h4>Third Party Updates</h4>
<p style="font-weight: bold;color: rgb(0,128,128);"><a name="SPM-125273"></a>WorkItem:SPM-125273 - Updating JDOM to Dom4j<br/><p>The JDOM library is a Java-based solution for accessing, manipulating, and outputting XML data from Java code. Its usage in Social Program Management was widespread across all areas of the application.<br/><br/>The JDOM library used by Social Program Management has now been removed and replaced by dom4j version 2.1.3. dom4j is an open-source XML framework for Java. dom4j allows you to read, write, navigate, create, and modify XML documents. Dom4j integrates with DOM and SAX and is integrated with full XPath support.<br/><br/>As a result of this upgrade, a number of changes have been made across all components of the Social Program Management application.<br/><br/>The changes to the JAR files include:<br/> <ul><li>CuramCDEJ\lib\ext\jar\jdom.jar - JDOM version removed. <li>CuramSDEJ\lib\jdom-1.0.jar - JDOM version removed. <li>CuramCDEJ\lib\ext\jar\dom4j.jar - dom4j version 2.1.3 added. <li>CuramSDEJ\lib\dom4j-2.1.3.jar - dom4j version 2.1.3 added.</ul>The jde-commons JARs delivered in the following CDEJ and SDEJ locations provide wrappers around the dom4j classes, where new external APIs provide a mostly backward-compatible API with JDOM. These APIs are located in the curam.common.util.xml.dom package.<br/> <ul><li>CuramCDEJ\lib\curam\jar\jde-commons.jar <li>CuramSDEJ\lib\jde-commons.jar</ul>It should be noted that any references in custom build scripts to the versioned JAR files should be updated to point to the new JAR files as specified above. Any custom code that uses JDOM should be migrated to instead use the dom4j wrapper classes provided by the CDEJ and SDEJ.<br/><br/>For more information about the changes associated with this update, see 'Migrating the JDOM library to the dom4j library' in the Cúram Upgrade Guide.</p></p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;color: rgb(0,128,128);"><a name="SPM-123834"></a>WorkItem:SPM-123834 (was previously 274649) - System message visibility field code-table blank value does not default to blank on edit of the record.<br/><p>A new drop-down field called 'Visibility' has been added to the table 'SystemMessage' in 8.0.1. The value determines the user group that the message is visible to, for example, 'Logged-in users', 'Public users' or 'Public and logged-in users'. For existing records on the 'SystemMessage' table, the value of the new field 'Visibility' is set to 'null'. The 'Visibility' field 'null' value has the same meaning as the default value of 'Logged-in user'. When a 'System Message' record with a 'Visibility' field value of 'null' is edited, the 'Visibility' field drop-down incorrectly defaults to 'Logged-in user' instead of a blank value. <br/><br/>To address this issue, an additional property 'USE_DEFAULT="false"' needs to be added to the 'Visibility' 'FIELD element of the page SystemMessage_modifySystemMessage.vim.
