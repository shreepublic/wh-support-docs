The weight reflects the percentage and number of questions in each test section.\n\n| Sections 1-3 | Weight | Topics |\n|--------------|--------|--------|\n| Cúram Business Infrastructure | 28% (20 questions) | Components of Cúram, Rules, User Interface, Workflow |\n| Cúram Platform | 38% (27 questions) | Administration, Case Management, Participant Management, Evidence Management, Financial Management |\n| Cúram Application Modules | 34% (24 questions) | Evidence Broker, Outcome Management, Provider Management, Universal Access, Verification |\n\nEach test section has a set of objectives, which you can use to identify the areas of knowledge and skills that the section covers.\n\nThe passing score is 66% (47 correct questions out of 71)\n\n**Section 1 – Cúram Business Infrastructure**\n\n+ Differentiate between the components of Cúram.\n+ Describe the usage of rules and evidence in Cúram.\n+ Identify the main components of the Cúram user interface.\n+ Identify and describe the main components of Cúram Workflow.\n\n**Section 2 – Cúram Platform**\n\n+ Describe the key features of system administration in Cúram.\n+ Identify the Cúram case types and articulate how cases can be used in Cúram.\n+ Define Cúram Participant Management and differentiate between Cúram participant role types.\n+ Outline the functionality of the Cúram evidence framework.\n+ Differentiate between the key financial management components in Cúram.\n\n**Section 3 – Cúram Application Modules**\n\n+ Articulate how the Cúram Evidence Broker Application Module addresses evidence sharing requirements.\n+ Describe the main functions of Cúram Outcome Management Application Module.\n+ State the purpose of the Provider Management (CPM) Application Module and define the main CPM user roles.\n+ Describe the overall purpose and main components of the Cúram Universal Access Application Module.\n+ Describe the concept of verification and differentiate between the elements that underpin the Cúram Verification Application Module.\n\n### Test Preparation\n\nAll test questions come from content in the main training manual and exercise workbook for CUR088 – Fundamentals of the Merative Cúram Platform for Business Analysts 8.X.\n\nHere is some advice that might help you prepare for and pass the test:\n\n+ It is recommended that certification candidates take the **Practice Test (P003)** before they attempt the **Certification Test (C003)**. In the test codes, C stands for Certification and P stands for Practice.\n+ The Practice Test contains the same number of questions as the Certification Test and is designed to have the same level of difficulty. Your score on the Practice Test provides a clear indication of whether you are ready to take the Certification Test or need to put in more prep work. Aim to take the Practice Test about a week before you plan to take the actual test.  \n+ Try to take the test approximately 2-5 weeks after completing CUR088 training course. You need to allow yourself time to study. However, if you wait too long after the course, you may start to lose some of what you learned.\n+ Keep in mind that anything in the course manual or exercise workbook is fair game for a test question.\n+ The Review the Concepts questions within the training course are a good way to test yourself. Do NOT take the test until you can answer all of the in-course questions from memory.\n+ For questions that have multiple answers, you will see prompts that tell you how many answers you should select. For example, the question stem will begin with “Which three…” and be followed by the prompt “Select 3”. Use these indicators to help you select or reject options.\n+ After you complete the test, you will receive a score report showing how you performed in each of the three sections. If you fail the test, this report can help you to identify the areas that need more study before you try again.","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"13d4cf17459a4066e8cb1fdcca084cc7","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":135},"frontmatter":{"title":"Cúram Business Analyst Certification V8.X","description":"Cúram Business Analyst Certification V8.X"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Cúram Business Analyst Certification V8.X\n\ndescription: Cúram Business Analyst Certification V8.X\n---\nimport { Link } from \"gatsby\"\n\n## C003 – Cúram V8.X Business Analysis – Certification\n\n### Test Overview and Structure\n\nThis entry-level Certification Test is intended for business analysts, consultants, services professionals, testers, and any other personnel who want to acquire the foundational Cúram knowledge that is required to work on Cúram implementation projects.\n\nThe following skills are essential for successful performance on this test:\n\n+ Working knowledge of health and human services programs\n+ Experience of the typical business analysis activities that relate to system implementations\n\nFamiliarity with enterprise applications and commercial off-the-shelf products will also be of benefit to test takers.\n\nTo prepare for this certification test, it is recommended that candidates study the following self-paced training course:\n\n+ CUR088: Fundamentals of the Merative Cúram Platform for Business Analysts 8.X.\n\nThe test contains three sections that together provide a total of 71 questions.
