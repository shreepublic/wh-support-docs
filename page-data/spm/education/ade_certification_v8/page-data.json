The weight reflects the percentage and number of questions in each test section.\n\n| Section | Weight | Topics |\n|--------------|--------|--------|\n| Cúram Infrastructure | 20% (10 questions) | Components of Cúram, runtime architecture, project folders, build targets, tracing and troubleshooting |\n| Server-Side Development | 60% (25 questions) | Classes and relationships, stereotype operations, class hierarchies, code tables, message files, validation and exception handling, and importing and exporting configuration data |\n| Client-Side Development | 30% (15 questions) | UIM elements; pages for create, read, modify, and search applications; application navigation and adding logic to pages |\n\nEach test section has a set of objectives, which you can use to identify the areas of knowledge and skills that the section covers.\n\nThe passing score is 70% (35 correct questions out of 50).\n\n**Section 1 – Cúram Infrastructure**\n\n+ Differentiate between the components of Merative Cúram, including the Application Modules and the Cúram Platform.\n+ State the purpose of the main components in the runtime architecture.\n+ Identify the project folders, file types, and tools in the Cúram Application Development Environment (ADE).\n+ Select the appropriate build target for a particular task.\n+ Perform tracing and troubleshooting.\n\n**Section 2 – Server-Side Development**\n\n+ Model the following classes: Domain Definition, Entity, Struct, Process, and Façade.\n+ Model the following associations: Index, Foreign Key, Assignable, and Aggregation.\n+ Define appropriate stereotype operations for Entity, Process, and Facade classes.\n+ Configure Cúram properties in the application model.\n+ Use generated artifacts in application code.\n+ Define code tables, data manager files, and message files.\n+ Implement exception handling and validation.\n+ Import and export configuration data.\n\n\n**Section 3 – Client-Side Development**\n\n+ Use the following common UIM elements: PAGE, CLUSTER, FIELD, CONNECT, LINK, PAGE_PARAMETER, SOURCE, TARGET, SERVER_INTERFACE, ACTION_SET, ACTION_CONTROL\n+ Implement UIM pages for create, read, modify, and search applications.\n+ Configure application navigation features.\n+ Implement the following client features:  select lists, views, online help, in-page navigation, wizards, expandable lists, containers, and images.\n+ Add logic to UIM pages by using scriptlets, JavaScript, and the CONDITION element.\n\n\n### Advice and Tips\n\n#### High-Level Steps\n\nTo earn C004 – Cúram V8.X ADE – Accreditation, follow these high-level steps:\n\n+ Master the material and  exercises in the following course - by taking instructor-led or self-paced training:\n    + *CUR090 - Merative Cúram for Developers (ADE) 8.X*\n+ Review the test sections and identify the associated objectives and topics.\n+ Take the Practice Test (P004) to see if you are prepared for the Accreditation Test (C004). \n+ Register for the Accreditation Test.\n+ Take and pass the Accreditation Test.\n\n#### Helpful Advice for Passing the Test\n\nHere is some advice that the Cúram Education team has gathered over the years from test takers to help you prepare for and pass the test:\n\n+ **Create a schedule**: There is a lot of material to review. The ADE course book contains almost 400 pages. In addition, you need to practice the skills you’ve learned in a Cúram development environment. Create a schedule with weekly deadlines so that you are not overwhelmed. Expect to spend about 30 – 40 hours preparing for the test after you complete the training courses. Do not leave too long a gap between completing the courses and preparing for the test. Note that additional features and details that are provided in the appendix of the course book are not examinable on the test.\n+ **Safety in numbers**: If possible, set up a study group to help meet deadlines and to support each other. Members often present topics to each other as a way of reviewing the material.\n+ **Know the test objectives**: The test objectives list the topics that you will be asked about. The objectives are closely aligned with the content of the training course. Copy the objectives to a spreadsheet and mark them off as you review them in the material and perform the associated skill in the ADE.\n+ **Be systematic**: Adopt a systematic approach when preparing, for example:\n    + Review the lesson in the course book, including the notes.\n    + Complete the exercise for the lesson. Note that you can load the sample solution of the previous exercise if necessary. Try to do the exercise without referring to the detailed steps.\n    + It is often useful to review the relevant section of the developer documentation to get an alternative explanation.\n+ **Make summary notes**: It’s useful to make summary notes or mind maps of topics, for example, key UIM elements, build commands, and the purpose of each application navigation file. The appendix includes some summaries, such as entity stereotypes.\n+ **Get hands-on practice**: Test questions will often ask you about sample code and UML diagrams. You must practice the skills to really understand the material. It is best to use the lab that you used for *CUR090 - Merative Cúram for Developers (ADE) 8.X*. If this lab has expired, the same lab is available for *CUR091 - Merative Cúram for Developers (Customization) 8.X* and *CUR092 – Merative Cúram Development Environment 8.X: Sandbox*. The lab provides a lightweight project (CourseWorkshop) where you can practice ADE development with very short build times. The lab contains sample solutions for course exercises, which you can load to enable you to perform the subsequent exercise.\n+ **Challenge your understanding**: Once you are confident that you can complete the course exercises, add features to the case study and customize it in the CourseWorkshop project. The *Cúram V8.X ADE Accreditation Preparation – Mini Project* lists features that you can add to your case study. Detailed steps are not provided so that you must think about which artifacts to change and how to change them.\n    + [C004_Preparation_Mini_Project.pdf](/pdf/education/C004_Preparation_Mini_Project.pdf)\n+ **Are you ready?**\n    + Ten sample test questions can be found here: [C004_SampleTestQuestions.pdf](/pdf/education/C004_SampleTestQuestions.pdf)\n    + Ask a senior developer or mentor to check if you are ready. The mentor can ask questions to test your understanding of the topics.\n    + Take the practice test, P004 – Cúram V8.X ADE – Practice, in Prometric - It is recommended that you take the Practice Test at least four days before you plan to take the actual test.\n+ **When taking the test**: Tips for answering the test questions:\n    + Read all of the information in the question.  \n    + For questions that have multiple answers, you will see prompts that tell you how many answers you should select. For example, the question stem will begin with “Which three…” and be followed by the prompt “Select 3”. Use these indicators to help you select or reject options.\n    + Do a quick first pass and answer the easier questions first.\n    + You can simplify multiple-answer questions by treating each option as a true/false question. \n    +Use the features in the tool to strike out options, highlight text, flag questions, and review attempted, unattempted, and flagged questions.  Before you begin the test, you will complete a tutorial that explains these features. \n+ **How did you do?** After you complete the Practice Test and the Accreditation Test, you will receive a score report showing how you performed in each of the tested sections. If you do not pass the test, this report can help you to identify the areas that need more attention before you try again. If you do not pass the first time, don’t give up. Many people take two or more attempts to pass it.\n+ **Questions?** Send us an email at [curameducation@merative.com](mailto:curameducation@merative.com)","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"d76ced621a5241e25b0320836857ff3a","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":132},"frontmatter":{"title":"Cúram V8.X ADE - Accreditation","description":"Cúram V8.X ADE - Accreditation"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Cúram V8.X ADE - Accreditation\n\ndescription: Cúram V8.X ADE - Accreditation\n---\nimport { Link } from \"gatsby\"\n\n## C004 – Cúram V8.X ADE - Accreditation\n\n### Test Overview and Structure\n\nThis accreditation confirms that the successful candidate has the knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to design, build, execute, and deploy Curam V8.X applications by using the Cúram Application Development Environment (ADE).\n\nThe test contains three sections that together provide a total of 50 questions.
