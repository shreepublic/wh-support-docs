Your score on the Practice Test provides a clear indication of whether you are ready to take the Certification Test or need to put in more prep work. It is suggested to take the Practice Test about a week before you plan to take the actual test.  \n+ Try to take the test approximately 2-5 weeks after completing this training course. You need to allow yourself time to study. However, if you wait too long after the course, you’ll start to lose some of what you learned. Keep in mind that anything in the course manual is fair game for a test question but try to focus on the main ideas and details of each lesson.\n+ The Review the Concepts questions within the training course are a good way to test yourself. Do NOT take the test until you can answer all of the in-course questions from memory.\n+ For questions that have multiple answers, you will see prompts that tells you how many answers you should select. For example, the question stem will begin with “Which three…”and be followed by the prompt “Select 3.” Use these indicators to help you select or eliminate some of the options.\n+ After you complete the test, you will receive a score report showing how you performed in each of the three tested sections. If you don’t pass the test, this report can help identify the areas that need more attention before you try again.","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"f18a10d8242434c8309bfc613c2837e9","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":134},"frontmatter":{"title":"Cúram (SPM) Business Analyst Certification V7.X","description":"Cúram (SPM) Business Analyst Certification V7.X"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Cúram (SPM) Business Analyst Certification V7.X\n\ndescription: Cúram (SPM) Business Analyst Certification V7.X\n---\nimport { Link } from \"gatsby\"\n\n## C002 – IBM Cúram SPM V7.X Business Analysis – Certification\n\n### Test Overview and Structure\n\nThis entry-level certification test is intended for business analysts, consultants, services professionals, testers, and any other personnel who want to acquire the foundational Cúram knowledge that is required to work on Cúram implementation projects.\n\nThe following skills are essential for successful performance on this test:\n\n+ Working knowledge of health and human services programs\n+ Experience of the typical business analysis activities that relate to system implementations\n\nThe following skills are suggested for successful performance on this test:\n\n+ Familiarity with enterprise applications and commercial off-the-shelf products\n\nTo prepare for this certification test, it is recommended that candidates study the following self-paced course:\n\n+ CUR072: Fundamentals of the Merative Cúram SPM Platform for Business Analysts 7.X.\n\nThe test contains three sections that together provide a total of 71 questions.
