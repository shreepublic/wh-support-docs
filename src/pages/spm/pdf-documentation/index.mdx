- The following update applies to the [Messaging architecture](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spm/8.0.2?topic=architecture-messaging) page in the *Social Program Management on Kubernetes* section.

  This note requires clarification:
  
  **Note:** Social Program Management supports only IBM MQ on a VM. IBM MQ on Kubernetes, IBM MQ as a service, and other message engines have not been verified with Social Program Management.

  The note should read as follows:

  **Note:** Social Program Management supports IBM MQ LTS on VMs only. IBM MQ CD is supported only as a container on OpenShift. IBM MQ on Kubernetes, IBM MQ as a Service, and other message engines have not been verified with Social Program Management.
