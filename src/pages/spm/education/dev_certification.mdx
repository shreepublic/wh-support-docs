## C001 – IBM Cúram SPM V7.X Application Developer – Certification

### Test Overview and Structure

This intermediate-level certification test confirms that the successful candidate has important knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to design, build, execute, and deploy Curam V7.X applications.

The test contains five sections that together provide a total of 70 questions. The weight reflects the percentage and number of questions in each test section.

| Sections 1-5 | Weight | Topics |
|--------------|--------|--------|
| Technical Infrastructure | 21% (15 questions) | Components of SPM, runtime architecture, product documentation, project folders, build targets, tracing and troubleshooting, localization, impact analysis.|
| Server-side Development | 30% (21 questions) | Classes and relationships, stereotype operations, class hierarchies, code tables, message files, validation and exception handling, import and export configuration data.|
| Client-side Development | 20% (14 questions) | UIM elements, pages for CRUDL applications, application navigation, add logic to pages.|
| Server-side Customization | 21% (15 questions) | Customizing non-source artifacts (message files etc), modeled classes, and non-modeled classes. Implementing web services, REST APIs, events, deferred processes, and batch processes.|
| Client-side Customization | 8% (5 questions) | Customizing pages, navigation, and property files. Options for customizing widgets.|

Each test section has a set of objectives, which you can use to identify the areas of knowledge and skills that the section covers.

+ Add logic to UIM pages using scriptlets, JavaScript, and the CONDITION element

**Section 4:  Server-Side Customization**

+ Customize the following artifacts compliantly: message files, code tables, data manager files, server configuration files, and configurable validations
+ Customize modeled classes compliantly
+ Customize non-modeled classes compliantly
+ Implement web services and REST APIs for real-time integration
+ Implement custom events, deferred processes, and batch jobs

**Section 5:  Client-Side Customization**

### Advice and Tips

**High-level Steps**

To earn your Cúram Developer Certification, follow these high-level steps:

1. Master the material and exercises in the following courses (attend a classroom teach or complete on a Self-Paced basis):

    *9D73G - IBM Cúram SPM for Developers (ADE) 7.X*

    *9D74G - IBM Cúram SPM for Developers (Customization) 7.X*

1. Review the test sections and identify the associated objectives and topics.

2. Take the assessment test to see if you are prepared for the certification test.

3. Register for the certification test.

4. Take and pass the certification test.

Refer to the [Curam_V7.X_Developer_Certification_Overview.pdf](/pdf/education/Curam_V7.X_Developer_Certification_Overview.pdf) for information about the structure of the test and how to register for it.

**Helpful Advice for Passing the Test**

Here is some advice that we have gathered over the years from test takers to help you prepare for and pass the test:

+ **Create a schedule:** There is a lot of material to review – the two course books contain over 700 pages in total. In addition, you need to practice the skills you've learned in a Cúram development environment. Create a schedule with weekly deadlines so that you are not overwhelmed. Expect to spend about 50-70 hours preparing for the test after you complete the training courses. Do not leave too long a gap between completing the courses and preparing for certification.


+ **Safety in numbers:** If possible, set up a study group to help meet deadlines and provide each other with support.


+ **Know the test objectives:** The test objectives list the topics that you will be asked about. The objectives are closely aligned with the content of the training courses. Copy the objectives to a spreadsheet and mark them off as you review them in the material and perform the skill in the ADE.


+ **Be systematic:** Adopt a systematic approach when preparing, for example:
  + Review the lesson in the course manual, including the notes.
  + Do the exercise for the lesson (note that you can load the sample solution of the previous exercise if necessary). Try to do the exercise without referring to the detailed steps.
  + Review the relevant section of the developer documentation, which gives an alternative explanation.


+ **Make summary notes:** It's useful to make summary notes or mind maps of certain topics, for example, how to customize each type of artifact, key UIM elements, and the purpose of each configuration file.


+ **Get some hands-on practice:** Test questions will often ask you about sample code and UML diagrams. You must practice the skills to really understand the material. It is best to use the sandbox image for the courses (the same image is used for 9D73G and 9D74G), as it provides a lightweight project (CourseWorkshop) where you can practice ADE development and customization without long build times. The image can also be accessed by registering for *9D77G – Merative Cúram SPM Development Environment 7.X: Sandbox*. The image contains sample solutions for course exercises to help you to revise.


+ **Challenge your understanding:** Once you are confident that you can complete the course exercises, add features to the case study and customize it in the CourseWorkshop project. The Developer Certification Preparation – Mini Project offers two assets that list features and customizations that you can add to your case study. Detailed steps are not provided so that you must think about the artifacts to change and how to change them.

    + [CaseStudyCertPrep_Part_II_Customize.pdf](/pdf/education/CaseStudyCertPrep_Part_II_Customize.pdf)


+ **Are you ready?**
  + Sample test questions can be found here: [Sample_Dev_Test_Questions.pdf](/pdf/education/Sample_Dev_Test_Questions.pdf)
  + Ask a senior developer to check your readiness.
  + Take the practice test (P001) in Prometric - It is suggested to take the Practice Test about a week before you plan to take the actual test.


+ **When taking the test: Tips for answering the test questions:**
  + Read all the information on the screen. If more than one answer is required, you will be told "Select two" or "Which three…".
  + Do a quick first pass and answer the easier questions first.
  + You can simplify multiple-answer questions by treating each option as a true/false question. You can strike-out options by using the test mark-up.


+ **How did you do?** After you complete the assessment test and the full certification test, you will receive a score report showing how you performed in each of the tested sections. If you don't pass the certification test, this report can help you to identify the areas that need more attention before you try again. If you do not pass the first time, don't give up. Many people took two or more attempts to pass it.
