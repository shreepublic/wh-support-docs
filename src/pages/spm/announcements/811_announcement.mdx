## Cúram 8.1.1

Cúram by Merative™ is a leading solution for supporting the end-to-end social program and care coordination service delivery process. Cúram 8.1.1 includes key enhancements to help caseworkers, and developers. In 8.1.1 release we have updated the name from Social Program Management to Cúram by Merative™. This does not change any entitlement, licenses for Social Program Management and Cúram are valid for this release.

### Person Evidence Management

In 8.1.1 we are releasing a new offering, Person Evidence Management, that allows person evidence to be managed centrally independent of any benefit. This person centric approach is especially advantageous to customers delivering benefits across multiple integrated cases:

* Benefit access can be restricted to only the caseworkers who need it, to ensure data privacy of citizens, without impact on caseworkers having visibility on the latest person evidence.

* All caseworkers will have access to person evidence regardless of status and won't be asking citizens for evidence that has already been submitted to the agency.

* Agencies can streamline their verification requirements on person evidence and have this evidence verified once across all the citizens' interactions with the agency, providing efficiencies to agencies in the processing of verification documentation.

* Support for digital updates to person evidence extended by removing the correlation to benefit delivery or entitlement.

Person Evidence Management integrates with platform business processes. Extending the offering to all our solutions; Income Support, Insurance Affordability, Child Welfare and Workers Compensation, will be based on customer interest. Please see ReadMe file with this release as the feature is separately licensed. The ReadMe is available from the Curam8110 installer directory in the README subdirectory.

### Caseworker productivity

Caseworker productivity improvements aim to improve the efficiency of completing a task as well as improve the user experience. 

In 8.1.1, we have improved the use of dropdowns in IEG across all tasks throughout SPM. The filtering mechanism in dropdowns has been enhanced to provide a combination of both 'starts with' and 'contains', making it easier and more intuitive for caseworkers to find and select the required value from the dropdown list. This aligns with the behaviour of dropdowns in modals to provide a consistent user experience in all drop-down throughout Cúram. 

In 8.1.1, focus on accessibility improvements continued. Improvements made across many of the WCAG guidelines, to reduce deviations and improve on accessibility compliance across all of the Cúram application. 

### Developer productivity

Introduced evidence sharing trigger points so that developers can compliantly customize the benefit application process to share evidence prior to the "authorize" stage and thus meet specific agency requirements.

For more details about these features, see the [What's new in 8.1.1](/pdf/spm/Curam_WhatsNew_811.pdf) and the [8.1.1 release notes](/pdf/releasenotes/curam811.pdf).
