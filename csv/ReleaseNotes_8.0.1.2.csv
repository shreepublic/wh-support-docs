<FIELD LABEL=""""Field.Label.Nickname""""> 
  <CONNECT> 
    <SOURCE NAME=""""DISPLAY"""" PROPERTY=""""result$dtls$searchWithNicknamesInd"""" /> 
  </CONNECT> 
  <CONNECT> 
    <TARGET NAME=""""ACTION"""" PROPERTY=""""personSearchKey$nicknameInd"""" /> 
  </CONNECT> 
</FIELD>

* Modify the field so that the LABEL is a child element instead of a FIELD attribute:

<FIELD> 
  <LABEL> 
    <CONNECT> 
      <SOURCE NAME=""""TEXT"""" PROPERTY=""""Field.Label.Nickname"""" /> 
    </CONNECT> 
   </LABEL> 
   <CONNECT> 
     <SOURCE NAME=""""DISPLAY"""" PROPERTY=""""result$dtls$searchWithNicknamesInd"""" /> 
   </CONNECT> 
   <CONNECT> 
     <TARGET NAME=""""ACTION"""" PROPERTY=""""personSearchKey$nicknameInd"""" />

SPM-128974,," IEG Application Form produces a Null Pointer Exception when navigating from one section to another via Left Panel Navigation",ENT,Intelligent Evidence Gathering,APIs,,"*Issue Description:*
An IEG application form produces a Null Pointer Exception error when navigating from one section to another via the left panel section navigation if there are disabled sections in between.

*User Interface Impact:* No

*Prerequisite(s):*
An IEG script with the following structure:

# Section navigation panel enabled (show-sections=""""true"""").
# The script contains 4 sections: Section A, Section B, Section C, and Section D.
# Section A contains a question page that is always enabled, with a Question A1 that will be used as criteria to display the Section B and Section C question pages.
# Section B contains a question page wrapped by a condition that evaluates Question A1 as criteria to display the question page.
# Section C contains a question page wrapped by a condition that evaluates Question A1 as criteria to display the question page.
# Section D contains a question page that is always enabled with at least one question.

*Steps to Reproduce:*

# Start the IEG script.
# In Section A, question A1 provides an answer that will ensure the question pages of Section B and Section C are not displayed, therefore not enabling the sections.
# Click Next.
# Section B and Section C are not displayed, and the navigator jumps to Section D.
# On the Section D question page, click the left panel navigation to go to Section A.
# On the Section A question page, click the left panel navigation to go to Section D.
# Issue: A Null Pointer Exception is displayed and the user cannot navigate to the desired section.

*Resolution:*
This issue is resolved. Disabled sections in an IEG script are now handled properly to avoid a Null Pointer Exception and the user can navigate to previous sections as expected.
