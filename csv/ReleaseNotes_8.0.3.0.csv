SPM-126689,DT036289,IEG Application Form produces  Null Pointer Exception when navigating between sections,ENT,Intelligent Evidence Gathering,APIs,,"**Issue Description:**
An IEG application form produces a Null Pointer Exception error when navigating from one section to another via the left panel section navigation if there are disabled sections in between.

**User Interface Impact:** No

**Prerequisite(s):**
An IEG script with the following structure:
 # Section navigation panel enabled (show-sections=""""true"""").
 # The script contains 4 sections: Section A, Section B, Section C, and Section D.
 # Section A contains a question page that is always enabled, with a Question A1 that will be used as criteria to display the Section B and Section C question pages.
 # Section B contains a question page wrapped by a condition that evaluates Question A1 as criteria to display the question page.
 # Section C contains a question page wrapped by a condition that evaluates Question A1 as criteria to display the question page.
 # Section D contains a question page that is always enabled with at least one question.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
 # Start the IEG script.
 # In Section A, question A1 provides an answer that will ensure the question pages of Section B and Section C are not displayed, therefore not enabling the sections.
 # Click Next.
 # Section B and Section C are not displayed, and the navigator jumps to Section D.
 # On the Section D question page, click the left panel navigation to go to Section A.
 # On the Section A question page, click the left panel navigation to go to Section D.
 # Issue: A Null Pointer Exception is displayed and the user cannot navigate to the desired section.

**Resolution:**
This issue is resolved. Disabled sections in an IEG script are now handled properly to avoid a Null Pointer Exception and the user can navigate to previous sections as expected.

"
SPM-125925,,Support for CMIS 1.1 Browser binding,CEF,Technical Services,CMIS Adapter,,"The Content Management Interoperability Services (CMIS) specification describes how clients and repositories communicate with each other and how the domain model is mapped to the raw data that is transferred. These modes of communication and the model-to-data mappings are called bindings.

The CMIS 1.0 specification defined two bindings, the Web Services binding, and the AtomPub binding; and the CMIS 1.1 specification added a third, the Browser binding.  For more information about the CMIS Binding types, see {{https://freecontent.manning.com/wp-content/uploads/the-browser-binding-with-a-cmis-repository.pdf}}.

Previously, a system administrator could configure a target system service of type 'Content Management Interoperability Service over Atompub'. That is, previously customers could choose one configuration:
 * CMIS 1.0 and Atompub binding
where the CMIS specification is configured on your CMS.

An additional target system service of type 'Content Management Interoperability Service over Browser Binding' has been added. Typically, the service extension URL differs between the bindings and the CMIS specifications. If you are using CMIS 1.1 and your repository supports the improved Browser binding, you can now use it. Changing to the Browser binding has no effect on the user as the behavior is the same.

The following validation message has been introduced to prevent a system administrator from configuring more than one active CMIS target system service: 'A target system service already exists for the Content Management Interoperability Service.'

Customers can choose one of three configurations:
 * CMIS 1.1 and Browser binding (recommended)
 * CMIS 1.1 and Atompub binding
 * CMIS 1.0 and Atompub binding (may be deprecated in the near future)
where the CMIS specification is configured on your CMS.

Note: Browser binding is not supported on a CMS using the CMIS 1.0 specification.
"
SPM-125917,DT036336," Incorrect date on evidence timeline on Incoming evidence screen for evidence types with no business start date",ENT,Evidence Broker,,,"**Issue Description:**
When evidence that has no business start date is shared to the Incoming Evidence page, the start date of the case to which the evidence is being shared is displayed by default as the start date of the evidence. Currently, when evidence without a business start date is shared to an application case, the incoming evidence timeline incorrectly displays 01/01/0001 for the start date of the evidence instead of defaulting to the case start date.

**User Interface Impact:** No

**Prerequisite(s):**
Evidence sharing should be configured for Person Case to Application Case for Contact Preferences evidence with Trusted Source set to No.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
 # Log in as an Insurance Affordability caseworker.
 # Register a person.
 # Add Contact Preferences evidence.
 # Create an application case.
 # Navigate to the incoming evidence list page on the application case.
 # Expand the row for Contact Preferences.
 # Issue: The timeline displays 01/01/0001 as a start date for the evidence.

**Resolution:**
A date that represents the start date of the application case is now displayed by default.

**Technical:**
Application cases do not populate a start date on the Case Header entity; instead, they use a registration date field. The logic on the incoming evidence page has now been updated to retrieve and display the registration date of the application case when shared evidence has no business start date. 
"
SPM-125894,,CER Expression statistics,CEF,Integrated Case Management,Eligibility & Entitlement,,"**Issue Description:**

"
SPM-125865,DT036326,A meaningful heading is not provided for screen reader users on the Case Search page,Accessibility,,,,"**Issue Description:**
The text in the page title bar on the Case Search page appears like a heading, but an HTML heading element is not used for this text. This causes the heading structure to appear incorrectly for screen reader users. The same text also appears twice on the page, which does not add value to the user.

**User Interface Impact:** No

**Steps to Reproduce:**
 # Log in as a caseworker.
 # Navigate to the Cases and Outcomes section.
 # Select Case Search from the shortcuts panel.
 # Use the browser developer tools to inspect the HTML used for rendering the text in the page title bar.
 # Issue: The text in the page title bar appears as a heading but an HTML heading element is not used to render it. The text also appears twice on the page.

**Resolution:**
The duplicated text has now been removed from the Case Search page and the text in the page title bar is now constructed using an HTML heading element.

SPM-125738,DT036309,Error displays when creating dynamic evidence where the relatedParticipant attribute is named 'caseParticipantRoleID',CEF,Dynamic Evidence,,,"**Issue Description:**
When the multi-participant operations feature is enabled for a Dynamic Evidence type, if that evidence type's metadata file defines a 'RelatedCPAttribute' element whose 'name' attribute is set to 'caseParticipantRoleID', then creating an instance of that evidence type produces an un-handled server exception.

**User Interface Impact:** No

**Prerequisite(s):**
# There needs to be a Dynamic Evidence type defined which has the attribute 'enableMultiMemberUpdates' set to 'true' in the RelCPCluster element.
# The Dynamic Evidence type definition also needs to have the 'relatedParticipant' attribute set to 'caseParticipantRoleID' and the 'name' attribute of the RelatedCPAttribute element should also be 'caseParticipantRoleID'.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
# Log in as an Insurance Affordability caseworker.
# Complete an application to create an application case.
# Navigate to the application case created.
# Create a new evidence item of the Dynamic Evidence type defined in the prerequisites.

The batch launcher fails when DB-to-JMS is enabled in conjunction with the WebSphere Liberty server.

When this occurs the server logs include one or both of the following messages:
* User ?UNAUTHENTICATED? does not have a role on CuramServer'
* java.lang.ClassCastException: curam.util.invoke.EJSLocal0SLEJBMethod_2b4572e3 incompatible with curam.util.invoke.Method 

**User Interface Impact:** No

**Steps to Reproduce:**
 # Set application property 'Database-to-jms - enable flag' to 'True'.
 # Set application property 'Database-to-jms - Notification batch launcher mode' to '1'.
 # Set application property 'Database-to-jms - Notification host name' and 'Database-to-jms - Notification port number' to reference an SPM application on WebSphere Liberty.
 # Run the batch launcher. 
 # Issue: [batchlauncher] A runtime exception occurred: An error occurred triggering the database-to-JMS server at '<host name>':'<port number>' (SSL mode: false). Note that properties `curam.batchlauncher.dbtojms.notification.host` and `curam.batchlauncher.dbtojms.notification.port` respectively must be set to the host and port number on which the Curam client application is deployed because the database to JMS server is part of the Curam client application.

**Resolution:**
When DB-to-JMS is enabled, the batch launcher can now authenticate with the server to obtain an LTPA token required by WebSphere Liberty to trigger a database-to-JMS transfer.

SPM-125161,,Corrupted PDF generated for Insurance Affordability applications submitted online in the caseworker application when PDF Summary Template enabled,ENT,Universal Access,,,"Issue Description:
A summary PDF template can be configured for use in creating PDF documents that are generated when an application is submitted. When the summary PDF template configuration is enabled, it is used for the generation of PDF documents for all scripts, without any exclusions. As a result, invalid PDFs were generated for non-supported IEG scripts that contained non-supported conditions as listed in the //Configuring the generic PDF summary template// section within the Configuring Curam Common Intake guide. For example, a corrupt PDF document was generated for the Insurance Affordability application IEG script because the script does not support summary PDF generation.

User Interface Impact:Yes

Steps to Reproduce:
 # Enable the new PDF summary template as documented in the //Configuring the generic PDF summary template// section within the Configuring Curam Common Intake guide.
 # Log in as an Insurance Affordability caseworker.
 # Register a new Person.
 # Submit an application for Insurance Affordability with minimum data.
 # Navigate to the Administration tab and select Attachments.
 # Download the PDF that is generated as part of the application case creation.
 # Issue: Observe that a corrupted PDF document is generated.

Resolution:
This issue is now resolved and the original data store PDF template is used to generate PDF documents for Insurance Affordability applications submitted in the online application when a summary PDF template is configured.

By default, the Insurance Affordability application IEG script is excluded from summary PDF generation through a new 'curam.intake.pdftemplate.iegsummarypagelayout.scriptexcludelist' environment variable. The environment variable defines a list of scripts to be excluded from summary PDF template generation if a summary PDF template is configured.

SPM-123800,DT032834,Nominee destination bank account not created automatically during case creation when only one active bank account exists for the nominee,ENT,Financial Management,,,"**Issue Description:**
When registering a product delivery, the case nominee creation logic sets the destination for both the bank account and address. The logic for determining the destination bank account looks for the bank accounts associated with the client. If there is just one bank account, this is set as the destination. If there is more than one, then the system cannot decide which bank account to set as the destination, and this step needs to be carried out manually by the caseworker.

Currently, the logic does not exclude bank accounts that are end-dated from the list. This results in the need for a caseworker to manually identify the destination bank account in scenarios where there is only one active bank account that could be automatically set during case creation.

**User Interface Impact:** No

**Steps to Reproduce (Generic):**
 # Log in as a caseworker.
 # Register a new Person (Robert Smyth).
 # Click the Evidence tab and select the New page action.
 # On the New Evidence modal, select the Add row-level action for the Bank Accounts evidence.
 # On the New Bank Accounts modal, add the mandatory details. Also, specify an end date in the past and leave the Preferred indicator unchecked.
 # Click Save.
 # Add a second Bank Account with a start date in the past, no end date, and check the Preferred indicator.
 # Click Save.
 # Click the Care and Protection tab.
 # Select Cases and click the New page action.
 # Create an integrated case for the client.
 # Add the necessary evidence and activate it.
 # Create an associated product delivery, ensuring to select an EFT delivery pattern.
 ** A case nominee is created but no destination bank account is set because the nominee has more than one bank account.
 # Add the necessary certification to the product delivery.
 # From the tab actions menu on the product delivery, select Submit for Approval.
 # On the Submit Case for Approval confirmation dialog click Yes.
 # Issue: The following exception is thrown - 'The case cannot be approved as the Nominee Robert Smyth has no bank account'.

**Resolution:**
No validation message is now displayed and the case can be submitted for approval.

The logic for creating a case nominee during the creation of a product delivery case now excludes end-dated bank accounts when determining what bank accounts can be used as the destination for EFT payments.

SPM-121098,PO09050,Payments can be generated on product delivery cases that have been suspended and manually reassessed prior to initial activation,ENT,Financial Management,,,"**Issue Description:**
Financial payments are intended to only be generated on a product delivery case after it has been initially approved and activated. If a product delivery case is suspended before initial activation and manually reassessed, financial payments can then be incorrectly generated on the case.

**User Interface Impact:** No

**Steps to Reproduce (Generic):**

**Scenario 1 (CER product):**
 # Log in as a caseworker.
 # Register a new Person.
 # Create an integrated case for the person.
 # Add evidence to the case to make the client eligible. Apply changes.
 # Add an associated product delivery to the integrated case.
 # Add certification to the product delivery if required.
 # Suspend the product delivery.
 # Click on the Determinations tab.
 # Use the Reassess page action to manually reassess the case.

 # Issue: A payment is incorrectly issues on the product delivery case which has not yet been activated.

**Resolution:**
Payments can no longer be issued on product delivery cases that have been suspended prior to initial activation. The issue was resolved by introducing a new validation to prevent a user from manually reassessing a suspended product delivery case that was never in an active state. If a caseworker attempts to do this now on either a CER or Classic case, the following validation message is presented:

'Case 'X' could not be reassessed as it has never been activated and it currently has a status of Suspended.'

SPM-118651,PO08723,"Payment Correction cases contain incorrect references to sample UIM pages under the Financials tab. ",CEF,Integrated Case Management,Common,,"**Issue Description:**
Under the Financials tab on Payment Correction cases sample UIM pages are incorrectly referenced. 

**User Interface Impact:** No

**Prerequisite:**

1. Remove the //sample component// before building the project.

**Steps to Reproduce (Generic):**
 # Log in as a caseworker.
 # Register a new Person.
 # Create an integrated case for the person.
 # Add the necessary evidence to make the person eligible and activate it.
 # Add an associated product delivery to the integrated case, payable 'Weekly By Cash In Advance'.
 # On the product delivery, select the Administration tab, User Roles section and select New Supervisor action and add the caseworker. 
 # Submit and activate the product delivery.
 # Click the Financials tab and select Transactions.
 # Use the Issue Payment page action to generate a payment.
 # Modify the certification on the product delivery and move the certification from date forward by 4 or more days. 
 ** Note that an associated overpayment (Payment Correction) is created.
 # Now modify the certification from date back to its original value. 
 ** Note that an associated underpayment (Payment Correction) is created.
 # Navigate to the Payment Correction underpayment case.
 # On the Payment Correction underpayment case, select the Administration tab, User Roles section and select New Supervisor action and add the caseworker. 
 # Submit, approve, and activate the case. 
 ** Doing this will result in a new underpayment (RBU) financial component being created.
 # Click the Financial tab on the Payment Correction underpayment and select Deductions and view Current Deductions and Deductions History.
 # The page does not load as the application was referencing a sample UIM page, which doesn't exist now, as the sample component was removed in the prerequisite(s) step.
 # Issue: Since Payment Corrections isn?t a sample case it shouldn?t be referencing sample UIMs.

**Resolution:** The necessary sample UIM content that was being referenced by pages in the core component has been moved to the core component and references to it have been updated in instances where this content has been renamed.

SPM-115759,,End dated or closed bank account being set as the nominee bank account,ENT,Financial Management,,,"**Issue Description:**
When a product delivery case is created, case nominee creation logic sets the destination for both the bank account and address for the nominee. The logic for determining the destination bank account looks for the bank accounts associated with the person serving as the nominee. If there is just one, then this bank account is set as the destination bank account even if it is not an active bank account. When the case is then submitted for approval, no validation is thrown to prevent the approval of the case and the use of the end-dated bank account as the nominee's destination bank account.

**User Interface Impact:** No

**Steps to Reproduce (Generic):**
 # Log in as a caseworker.
 # Register a new Person (Robert Smyth).
 # Click the Evidence tab and select the New page action.
 # On the New Evidence tab select the Add row-level action for the Bank Accounts evidence.
 # Add the mandatory details, including an end date in the past.
 # Click Save.
 # Click the Care and Protection tab.
 # Select Cases and click the New page action.
 # Create an integrated case for the client.
 # Add the necessary evidence and activate it.
 # Create an associated product delivery, ensuring to select an EFT delivery pattern.
 ** A case nominee is created and a destination bank account is set to the bank account created in steps 4 and 5.
 # Add the necessary certification to the product delivery.
 # From the tab actions menu on the product delivery, select Submit for Approval.
 # On the Submit Case for Approval confirmation dialog click Yes.
 # Issue: No validation is thrown to indicate that the bank account that has been set as the nominee's destination bank account is end-dated.

**Resolution:**
A validation message 'The case cannot be approved as the Nominee Robert Smyth has no bank account.? is now displayed to indicate that the bank account that has been specified for the destination bank account cannot be used and to prevent the case from being submitted for approval.

The logic has been updated to now check that the bank account status is 'Open', the record status of the bank account is 'Active', and that the end date has not been specified to some date in the past.
