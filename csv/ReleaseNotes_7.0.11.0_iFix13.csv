*Resolution:*
An issue existed with the logic for determining third-party payments. A check was present to determine if the payment amount was negative, however, in the instance where this was the case, the proper adjustment was not performed to readjust the total amount value. This update is now in place and a negative payment amount will never be issued for third-party payments.
