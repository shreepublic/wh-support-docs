SPM-129895,DT036748,Cúram Session Timeout issue when minimizing browser,CEF,Application Development Environment,,,"*Issue Description:*
An IntensiveWakeUpThrottling feature has been introduced into the Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome browsers. This feature aggressively throttles JavaScript timers running in background tabs.

This new browser feature has affected some features in the Cúram application, specifically those associated with timers. One such feature is the Session Timeout feature which can be adversely affected if the browser window containing the countdown timer is minimized.

*User Interface Impact:* No

*Steps to Reproduce:* N/A

*Resolution:*
Additional functionality has been added to the Cúram Session Timeout feature to mitigate the effect of the browser IntensiveWakeUpThrottling setting and ensure that the timer works correctly even if the Session Timeout browser window has been minimized.

SPM-129886,,Person Evidence Management enhancement,CEF,Application Development Environment,Participant Management,Infrastructure,"Person Evidence Management provides a new approach to managing person evidence. Caseworkers can now use Person Evidence Management to maintain evidence centrally at the person level. 

A complete lifecycle of evidence management is provided at the person level allowing caseworkers to interact with person evidence using an Evidence Workspace. This workspace provides an Evidence Dashboard, as well as Active and In-edit evidence lists. The evidence associated with a person is not tied to any specific case. This independence allows caseworkers to access the latest version of evidence and verification statuses without needing to navigate across multiple integrated cases. 

This approach enhances efficiency by providing caseworkers with a dedicated space to manage evidence related to individuals, thereby improving accessibility and ensuring the most up-to-date information is available without being constrained by case-specific access permissions.

SPM-129647," DT036727",Applications that have applicants who have special characters in their names cannot be withdrawn,CEF,Application Development Environment,,,"*Issue Description:*
Applications cannot be withdrawn when applicants have special characters in their names, for example, O?Connor, O?Brien - the Withdraw button is unresponsive. Attempting to withdraw an application for an applicant with special characters in their name causes the Withdraw button to become unresponsive for applicants without special characters in their names.

*User Interface Impact:* No

*Steps to Reproduce:* 

*Scenario 1*

# Log in as an Insurance Affordability caseworker.
# Register a person who has a special character in their name, for example, First name: Person and Last name: O?Brien.
# Submit a new Insurance Affordability application.

# Submit a new application.
# Open the application case and click on the Authorization tab.
# Navigate to Withdrawals and select the Withdraw link.
# Issue: The Withdraw Program modal does not open. 

*Resolution:*
The issue was resolved by escaping special characters in the name, allowing the Withdraw Program modal to open.

SPM-129257,,Incorrect reciprocal relationship evidence type set for prospect persons with no gender specified,CEF,Common Evidence,,,"*Issue Description:*
When creating a relationship evidence record where the reciprocal relationship is determined based on gender, for example, an Uncle/Nephew relationship or an Aunt/Nephew relationship, the reciprocal relationship type for a prospect person with no gender specified is incorrectly defaulted to the same relationship type as the related person. For example, Uncle is incorrectly displayed in both the Person and Prospect Person relationship evidence description instead of displaying Uncle on the Prospect Person evidence and Nephew on the Person evidence.

*User Interface Impact:* No

*Steps to Reproduce:*

# Log in as a caseworker.
# Register a Person as a male. 
# Register a Prospect Person without a gender.
# Add Relationship evidence for the Prospect Person.
# From the New Relationship page, select the drop-down list for Case Participant and select the Prospect Person.
# From the Participant section, search for the Person and select them.
# From the Relationship Details section, select the drop-down list for type and select Uncle. 
# Click Save & Exit. 
# Observe the Evidence list for the Prospect Person, the Relationship record is displayed as expected with the description ?Uncle of Prospect Person is Person?. 
# Issue: Navigate to the Evidence tab for the Person. The relationship evidence description displays ?Uncle of Person is Prospect Person? instead of the expected description ?Nephew of Person is Prospect Person?.

*Resolution:*
The issue has been resolved by updating the API that sets the reciprocal relationship type so that the male gender relationship type is selected by default when a relationship is added for a prospect person with no gender specified. For example, when Uncle is selected as the relationship type for a Person, then Nephew will be selected by default as the reciprocal relationship type when the related Prospect Person does not have a gender selected.

SPM-129022,DT036720,Live Financial Component is incorrectly created on case suspension when curam.miscapp.payuptosuspendeddate = NO,CEF,Financial Management,,,"*Issue Description:*
Suspending a case being paid in arrears leaves one or more live financial components on the database even if the system property to pay up to the suspended date is set to 'NO'.

*User Interface Impact:* No

*Prerequisite(s):*

# Log in as a system administrator.
# On the shortcuts panel, click on Property Administration below Application Data.
# Enter 'Pay up to Suspended Date' in the Name text box and click Search.
# For the entry returned, use the Edit Value row-level action to modify the value to NO.
# Click Save.
# Publish the changes.

*Steps to Reproduce:*

# Log in as a caseworker.
# Register a new Person.
# Add a new integrated case for the person.
# Add evidence at the integrated case level.
# Activate the evidence.
# Now add a product delivery, 'Monthly in Arrears On Day 1 Of The Month - 14-day offset'
# Add certification one month in the past and 11 months in the future.
# Submit, approve and activate the product delivery.
# Issue the payment for the first month of certification.
# Roll the server forward to a date in the second month of certification that will allow the payment for that month to be issued.
# Issue the payment for the second month of certification - the last paid to date for the second month will be the last day of that month.
# Now roll the server forward to a date early in the third month of certification.
# Make an evidence change effective on day 1 of the third month of certification. This evidence should typically cause an eligibility change.
# Activate the evidence.
# Suspend the product delivery.
# Issue: When the database is examined, the Financial Component entity will contain one or more live financial components even though the system property 'Pay up to Suspended Date' is set to 'NO'.

*Resolution:*
The underlying problem here is that there was a loophole in the case suspension logic which didn't cater for the scenario where an effective dated change would occur after the last paid to date of the affected component. This issue has been resolved by updating the logic to cater to the circumstance where this is possible.

SPM-128696,DT036248,"Cúram Universal Access Responsive Web Application: IEG questions defined in conditionally hidden clusters but not referenced by read-only element are included in the form ",ENT,Intelligent Evidence Gathering,,,"*Issue Description:*
IEG questions that are defined in conditionally hidden clusters are incorrectly displayed in forms. In the forms, only questions that are referenced by read-only elements should be displayed.

*User Interface Impact:* No

*Steps to Reproduce:* 

# Update an IEG script to contain a static conditional cluster that starts a custom function without a read-only expression.
# In the Universal Access Responsive Web Application, apply for a benefit by using the updated IEG script.
# Issue: Observe that the hidden Boolean value is included in the response, which results in a checkbox that should be hidden being displayed on the IEG page. As a result, unexpected behavior might occur that might impact other pages that contain conditional clusters that reference the same question.

IEG pages that contain static conditional clusters, and that start custom functions without read-only-expressions, have been updated. The IEG pages no longer display hidden checkboxes.

"
SPM-128694,DT036712,Changing control question answers in IEG can cause unhandled server exception and data loss,CEF,Intelligent Evidence Gathering,,,"*Issue Description:*
IEG may delete data for the incorrect record when control questions are modified.

*User Interface Impact:* No

*Steps to reproduce*

# Create an IEG script that contains a nested loop for adding and editing parent and child records. For example, you can add a household member, and then you can add an income record by answering the question 'Does X have income?' which will conditionally enter a set of pages to add the income record. Note the outer loop must contain pages.
# Create a Summary page in the script that allows you to edit the Parent record to change the control question that adds the child record. That is, an edit link to the page where the question is asked.
# Run the script and add 3 parent records and 3 child records. For example, add John, Mary and Tom and for each household member select yes for 'Does X have income' and add the income amount.
# Continue to the summary page and select the edit button on the second parent record. For example, edit Mary's record and select No when asked 'Does Mary have income?'.
# Continue to the summary page and select the edit button on the third parent record. For example, edit Tom?s record and select No when asked 'Does Tom have income?'.
# Continue to the summary page and select the edit button on the second parent record. For example, edit Mary?s record and select Yes when asked 'Does Mary have income?'
# Issue: The update fails on clicking next with ?Something went wrong. Try again or go to home.' Additionally, data is lost for the previous record in the loop. For example, if Tom?s control question 'Does Tom have Income' was changed to No then Mary?s record is deleted.

*Resolution:*
Now IEG correctly handles the modification of control questions that drive the addition and removal of Datastore entities.

SPM-128640,,Error occurs when setting a new default nominee who has different components than the old nominee,CEF,Financial Management,,,"*Issue Description:*
When setting a case nominee as the default, the intention is to assign the components currently assigned to the (old) default nominee to the new default nominee. Other nominees can exist on the case, as in a third nominee, but any components assigned to them should be left untouched as they are not the default nominee. An issue has been found when setting the default nominee, that all components on the case are being assigned to the new default nominee even if they were not assigned to the old default nominee. This is not correct. Only the components assigned to the old default nominee should be assigned to the new default nominee.

*User Interface Impact:* No

*Steps to Reproduce:*

# Log in as a caseworker.
# Register person 1.
# Add Bank Account evidence for person 1.
# Create an integrated case for person 1.
# Create a product delivery with a delivery pattern of EFT.
# Register person 2.

# Assign a component to Person 3 and select save. 
# Expand the case nominee details for person 2 and select Set to set Person 2 as the Default Nominee.
# Issue: An unhandled server exception occurs.

*Resolution:*
This issue has been resolved by updating the API for setting the default nominee to only retrieve the components assigned to that nominee for reassignment to the new default nominee and not all the components on the case irrespective of who they are assigned to.

When using IEG in the Universal Access Responsive Web Application sections may be incorrectly disabled while editing from a summary page.

*User Interface Impact:* No

*Steps to Reproduce:*

The issue arises under the following conditions.

# Create an IEG script with a summary page that allows you to edit a record.
# On the question page use a question that has a default value in the schema and also is used in a control question in a subsequent section so that changing the answer will disable that section in the section navigation and should force the user back through the script.
# Run the script and answer the questions so that you arrive at the summary page with the edit link that will bring you back to the question page from 2.
# Select the edit link to navigate to the question page, don't change anything and select next. You should be brought back to the summary page.
# Issue: You are not returned to the summary page when clicking Next, instead IEG determines that the answer has been changed which disables the section and forces you back through the script.

*Resolution:*
IEG now correctly handles scenarios where the user does not change control question answers when editing from the summary page.

"
SPM-128616,,IEG rules expression resolver uses data from previous iteration,CEF,Intelligent Evidence Gathering,,,"*Issue Description:*
In IEG, when using custom validations in a filtered loop, the validation may receive incorrect list item data.

*User Interface Impact:* No

*Steps to Reproduce:*

# Create a script that includes a loop for adding parent and child records, for example, adding a household member and adding a pregnancy record for them.
# In the parent loop create a page with a conditional question to decide if the child record is added. For example, 'Is <Person> Pregnant?
# Create a custom validation after the child loop that checks if the pregnancy information is correct. This callout must be outside the child loop so that it is called for all parent records, not just the ones that created a child record.
# Run the script and add the first parent and child record, for example, Mary who is pregnant.
# Add a second person, for example, Joan who is not pregnant.
# Issue: The custom callout for the second record will receive the incorrect record, for example, the data for the previous household member will be passed to the callout function. This will lead to an invalid validation using the incorrect data or could cause issues such as null pointer exceptions.

*Resolution:*
Now, IEG supports this script pattern and will pass the correct record to the callout function. However, it is recommended that the script pattern should be changed to only call custom validations when necessary. For example, in the example above the custom validation could be moved inside the child loop.

SPM-128580,DT036623,Browser back button causes the UA script engine to lose track of the end page defined for a summary page link,CEF,Intelligent Evidence Gathering,,,"*Issue Description:*
When you add or edit a record from the summary page of an IEG script and use the browser back button (rather than the IEG back link) to go back, you are navigated to the next page of the script instead of back to the summary page.

*User Interface Impact:* No

*Steps to Reproduce:*

# Use an IEG script with a loop that contains two or more pages for adding a record, followed by another question page, and then a summary page that includes the record list with an Add link or Edit link. The Add and Edit links are defined with the start and end pages and the ?skip-to-summary? is set to true.
# Launch the IEG script from step 1 and complete the script to the summary page.
# Use the Add or Edit link to re-enter the loop to add a record or to edit a record.
# Complete the first page of the loop to land on the second page.
# Use the browser back button to return to the first page.
# Use the Next button to return to the second page.
# Complete the second page.
# Click Next to return to the summary.
# Issue: The script should navigate back to the summary page based on the ?skip-to-summary? attribute being set to true. However, it does not skip. Instead, the script continues to the next page which is defined in the script. This occurs only when you use the back button in the loop.

*Resolution:*
After the script completes the add record or edit record page loop, the script now correctly navigates to the summary page.

When trying to set a case nominee as the default, where the case nominee has active bank account evidence but no destination bank account is set on the product delivery case, the expected validation is not displayed.

*User Interface Impact:* No

*Steps to Reproduce:*

# Log in as a caseworker.
# Register person 1.
# Register person 2.
# Create an integrated case for person 2.
# Add a product delivery with a delivery pattern of 'Weekly in advance by EFT'.
# Add person 1 as a case nominee with a delivery pattern of EFT.
# Navigate to person 1, add Bank Account evidence.
# Expand person 1 nominee and attempt to set person 1 as the default nominee.
# Issue: The validation ?This nominee is already the default nominee for this case? is displayed instead of ?The default nominee could not be changed as the nominee <nominee name> has no bank account?.

*Resolution:*
The logic inside the API for setting the default nominee was updated to throw the correct validation where the delivery pattern on the product delivery is EFT, but no destination bank account exists for that case nominee.

SPM-128505,,IEG navigation using the add link and edit link may not be consistent for some script design patterns,CEF,Intelligent Evidence Gathering,,,"*Issue Description:*
In IEG, the Universal Access React Application ?processing from summary' via the ?add link? and 'edit link? features was inconsistent depending on the script design and the navigation path the user had taken. In some scenarios, the navigation was incorrect when navigating from the summary to an add or edit page-set and back to the summary. 

*User Interface Impact:* No

*Steps to Reproduce:*

# Create an IEG script.
# Include in the script a set of pages (2 or more) that create a record, for example, a set of pages to create an income record. Include a conditional page at the end of the set of pages which is driven by a conditional question on a previous page.
# Include a summary page that includes an ?add link? to create the record. Specify the start and end page for the ?add link?, and use the page that is wrapped in a conditional to be the end page.
# Run the script and select the ?add link? to create the record.
# Navigate through the set of pages, but select the conditional value that will hide the end page.
# Issue: When the ?end page? is hidden the script will not return to the summary page as expected, instead it will continue to the next page in the script. When using the ?edit link? in the above scenario the next page will be the next iteration of the loop; that is, you will begin editing the next record instead of returning to the summary page.

*Resolution:*
IEG has been improved to take account of more script design patterns and a wider range of user navigation paths when considering what the next page is when the user navigates so that the user is provided with a predictable user experience.

*User Interface Impact:* No

*Steps to Reproduce:*

# Create a script with a relationship page element and a summary page that allows you to edit the relationships.
# Load a script with pre-populated data, including People and relationships
# Try to edit the relationship record for 1 of the additional Household members; that is, not the primary Household member.

SPM-127548,,"Support capturing JMX statistics per batch program statistics ",CEF,Application Development Environment,Server Development Environment,Batch Processing,"*Issue Description:*
It is not possible to capture accurate JMX statistics for batch programs. The only way to do so is to enable the JMX timer but this affects the whole application and, because these JMX reports are time-based, they do not match the life cycle of a batch program.

*User Interface Impact:* No

*Steps to Reproduce:*

# Log in as a system administrator.
# Select the System Configurations tab and expand the shortcuts panel.
# Expand the Application Data section and click Property Administration.
# Set property ?Statistics Output Timer - Enable Timer' to 'True?.
# Set property 'Statistics Output Timer - Output Folder' to a directory on the server file system.
# Run a batch program, for example: build.sh runbatch -Dbatch.program=curam.core.intf.DetermineProductDeliveryEligibility.process 
# Check the output directory you specified above
# Issue: If the batch program ran for less than 300 seconds (or whatever value was specified by property 'Statistics Output Timer - Timer Period'), no JMX report was generated for it.
