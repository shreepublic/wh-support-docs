SPM-131019,,Extend FCProcessingDtls to support the distribution of payments throughout the week for a Set Benefit Week,ENT,Financial Management,,,"*Issue Description:*
There is no caseID and/or primaryClientID passed into the MaintainFinancialComponent.setNextProcessingDate() API. These are required for a future implementation of a dynamic offset calculation based on case and/or primary client.

*User Interface Impact:* No 

*Steps to Reproduce:*

N/A

*Resolution:*
The FCProcessingDtls details struct that?s passed into the MaintainFinancialComponent.setNextProcessingDate() API has been extended to support the calculation of a dynamic offset based on case and/or primary client. The delivery of the interface to calculate the dynamic offset is not being delivered here, this will be in a future release. This change future-proofs the application so that the caseID and primaryClientID are set on the FCProcessingDtls struct and passed into MaintainFinancialComponent.setNextProcessingDate(). Where these details are not being assigned implicitly from a financial component entity details struct, the details are set explicitly.
