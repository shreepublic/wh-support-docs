For example, a tab actions menu on a person tab, where the New Note menu item is configured inline and opens a New Note modal which has been configured with a resolve UIM (containing a JSP_SCRIPTLET element) that depends on the ?_o3rpu? parameter to redirect the user.

*Steps to Reproduce:*

# Log in as a caseworker.
# Register a person.
# Select the ?New Note? inline action button within tab action menu.
# Create the note by selecting the Save button.
# Issue: An application error occurs.

*Resolution:*
When you open a modal from an inline action within a tab action menu and subsequently select a link or button, the user interface is correctly updated.

*Technical:*

When a user selects an inline action within a tab action menu, the ?_o3rpu? HTTP request parameter is added to the request so it will be present when resolver UIM pages use it to redirect users to another page or modal.
