SPM-126766,,Generated post data access methods for <<nsread>> and non-void <<ns>> entity operations do not have access to the resulting data struct,CEF,Application Development Environment,Server Development Environment,Data Access Layer,"**Issue Description:**
Post-data-access exit points are generated methods produced by the Cu?ram Server Development Environment for Java (SDEJ) Code Generator. These methods get invoked by the infrastructure after accessing the database and before returning to the caller.
Post-data-access exit points which are generated for non-standard read entity operations (identified by the <<nsread>> stereotype) and for non-standard handcrafted SQL entity operations (identified by the <<ns>> stereotype) do not have access to the resulting data struct which may have been populated after accessing the database.

**User Interface Impact:** No

**Resolution:**
An additional argument in the method signature of post-data exit points for <<ns>> and <<nsread>> entity operations is now generated, which enables the resulting data struct from the database call to be accessed before returning to the caller.
If your custom code utilises Post-data-access exit points for these operation stereotypes it may be impacted by this change.
